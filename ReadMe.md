**FreeBsdConfig:**
Just another TrueOS config to help newcomers out 


For openbsd, i just installed trueos, use a good usb stick if the first one doesn't work, i'll upload files as I go

**VIM** 
In Freebsd/trueos, there's a default vime configuration file in ~/.vimrc. Delete it, and use josues instead
